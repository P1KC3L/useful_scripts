# USEFUL SCRIPTS

Here you can find some scripts that may help you to automatize software installations, use of repetitive commands, etc.

To use it, you should `git clone` this repo on your machine. Please, take into account that there will be some scripts specifically made for Windows and some others for Linux. In the `README.txt` file I've specified the target system for each script.
